    <h4 class="text-info text-center mb-5">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) / FEQ (Frequently Expected Questions)</h4>
    <h2 class="py-3">> Why the price is so high or so low?</h2>
    <p class="h5 text-body">
      The prices for our service is "reasonable" period. The only possibility is that it may progressively go up.
    </p>
    <p class="h5 text-body">
      <strong>Why High?</strong><br>The service you are getting is top of the marks considering -
      <ul>
        <li>We have near-native fluency in English</li>
        <li>We are easy to communicate and tech</li>
        <li>We are academically and professionally successful individuals looking to help and learn from others </li>
      </ul>
      We have the empathetic understanding of internet communities, investigative curiosity in implementing automation in mundane tasks and we are always desperate to learn about new things and meet new people.
    </p>
    <p class="h5 text-body">
      <strong>Why so low?</strong><br>
      If you want to pay more just, pay more (!). <br> We are starting a new business. We don't have an excellent portfolio yet. Moreover not being a US business so we are forced to keep a low priced service.
    </p>
    <div class="m-3"></div>
    <h2 class="py-3">> Can you bring me "X" number of follows or "Y" number of likes in "Z"days?</h2>
    <p class="h5 text-body">I am sorry this is not a goal-driven service. This service strives to be the best social media management, digital marketing and virtual assistance service. We can't guarantee you an exact figure. This is not a click farm service.</p>
    <p class="h5 text-body">Most of the service that guarantees any nominal number is oftentimes highly reliant on bots or click farms. </p>
    <p class="h5 text-body">We on the other hand stride to provide the best bang for your bucks but moreover, we are constantly on the lookout of implementing and experiment with newest strategies to your business.</p>
    <div class="m-3"></div>
    <h2 class="py-3">> What is the terms of payment?</h2>
    <p class="h5 text-body">For the time being, we are only expecting payment through PayPal and exclusively in US Dollar on weekly or job basis/</p>
    <div class="m-3"></div>
    <h2 class="py-3">> Can you give me the accounts you have previously managed?</h2>
    <p class="h5 text-body">
      We really can't do that. Privacy is the name of the game. Often for small businesses, we have to represent or even act like we are the persons running the business. It is disrespectful to them if we expose their name so we can get more gigs and contracts. We will take this same attitude we are running your business. It is better for us to not get the job then to talk about our existing or past clients.
    </p>
    <p class="h5 text-body">
      Please see our <b-link to="/case">Case Studies</b-link> section and our <b-link to="/skills">skillset</b-link> to make an informed decision. Or just send us an email to get an independent case study on your business.
    </p>
    <div class="m-3"></div>
    <h2 class="py-3">> What time zone you follow?<div class="m-3"></div></h2>
    <p class="h5 text-body">
      We follow close to a 20 hour cycle time zone coverage because our team is based on multiple time zones. But we mainly follow the US standard time.
    </p>
    <div class="m-3"></div>
    <h2 class="py-3">> So, let me see a business grad turned programmer and US-educated engineer; I still can't believe why so gosh darn cheap?<div class="m-3"></div></h2>
    <p class="h5 text-body">
      Again, this price is reasonably set for the time being. It will go up once we have more jobs. Hire us first, if see the value in us and if you want to pay more, you can. :)
